# Artwork: what may live here

Only reviewed application artwork belongs here. User files and caches stay out.

The files below belong to this application. None came from Black Desert Online
or another game archive. Provenance is listed per file; do not guess missing
details.

## Current icon and moonlit home artwork

The 2026-09-09 refresh uses `icons/app_icon.png`, its multi-size Windows
`icons/app_icon.ico`, and `ui/home/home_moonlit_atelier_v3.png`.
The previous salon image below is retained as an unused reference.
See [generation provenance and exact prompts](ARTWORK_REFRESH_20260909.md).

## `ui/home/home_aristocratic_salon_v2.png`

- Generated on 2026-08-01 with the built-in OpenAI ImageGen tool in
  identity-preserving edit mode.
- A maintainer-supplied character render was used as the identity, costume,
  palette, hairstyle, bow, and black-gold wing-ornament reference.
- Direction: the referenced white-haired yellow-and-white fantasy musician
  actively composes with quill and keyboard in a medieval fantasy game-world
  atelier. The production revision scales and anchors her on the right while
  retaining natural low-detail stone architecture on the left; application
  code supplies the readability gradient instead of baking in a black void.
- Palette: charcoal stone, black walnut, warm gold, yellow and ivory, with
  restrained blue magical notation accents under sunset and lantern light.
- Constraints included no text, logo, watermark, readable score, official
  insignia, modern objects, or copied characters.

## `ui/loading_noble_maestra_v2.png`

- Retained as an unused visual concept and intentionally excluded from the
  packaged application. Startup now reveals the prepared home surface in place
  instead of crossfading between unrelated character artwork.
- Generated on 2026-08-01 with OpenAI ImageGen in `stylized-concept` mode.
- A maintainer-supplied pink-haired elf render was used as the identity,
  costume, flower accessory, and gray-guitar reference.
- Direction: a full-bleed portrait view of the referenced musician playing her
  guitar in a vaulted fantasy atelier. The production crop carries the
  character, instrument, embroidered dress, music desk, and candlelit workshop
  continuously through the complete startup canvas; loading text sits directly
  over the natural lower scene without a footer box or empty panel.
- Constraints included no text, logo, watermark, readable score, official
  insignia, modern objects, or copied characters.

## `ui/home/home_mountain_workshop_v1.jpg`

- Generated on 2026-07-29 with OpenAI ImageGen from a character image supplied
  by the maintainer as costume, palette, and silhouette reference.
- Direction: a wide dark-fantasy mountain music workshop at sunset, with the
  white-haired yellow-and-white musician on the right and low-detail dark rock
  negative space on the left for the application's functional overlay.
- The generated source was converted locally from PNG to an optimized,
  progressive JPEG without repainting its content.
- Constraints included no text, logo, watermark, readable score, or UI frame.

## `ui/timeline_background_v2.png`

- Generated on 2026-07-26 with OpenAI ImageGen in `stylized-concept` mode.
- No reference image was supplied.
- Direction: a restrained dark-fantasy music atelier, charcoal ambience,
  subtle amber and teal light, instrument silhouettes near the lower edge, and
  broad low-detail negative space for a dense MIDI grid.
- Constraints included no text, logo, watermark, game character, readable
  score, or copyrighted franchise imagery.

## `icons/shai_ensemble_mark.png`

- Generated on 2026-07-29 with OpenAI ImageGen without a reference image.
- Direction: an original compact white-haired fantasy musician/conductor mark
  in ivory, charcoal, and warm gold for the shared application toolbar.
- A flat green generation background was removed locally, the transparent
  artwork was tightly cropped, and the toolbar asset was reduced to 192 px.
- It is a thematic mascot, not an official class emblem or game logo; the
  adjacent five indicators are drawn live by the application.
- Constraints included no text, official logo, watermark, UI container, or
  copied character artwork.

## `instruments/ai_v1/*.png`

- Generated on 2026-07-26 with OpenAI ImageGen in `stylized-concept` mode.
- No reference image was supplied.
- The source atlas requested twelve original instrument-family silhouettes in
  a strict 4-by-3 grid: piano, harp, guitar, bowed strings, flute, reed, horn,
  synthesizer, hand drum, cymbals, drum set, and handpan.
- The green atlas background was removed locally; crops were cleaned and
  exported as transparent PNG files without repainting their content.
- Constraints included no labels, logos, watermarks, people, decorative
  frames, or copyrighted franchise imagery.
